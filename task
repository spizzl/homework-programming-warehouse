What to do:
You're programming a warehouse system, that has products. Products have states, e.g. Out of order, Stocked, Ordered etc.

Things I want to see:
1. Menu Option: Register new Products (use a class) (Bonus: Save it into a .txt, .csv or Excell file for persistancy)

2. Function to Check Product available (in stock, out of stock, ordered)

3. Menu Option: Place Order (Bonus, if you do it with a class and with multiple products, but not necessary. Super Bonus if you are able to create a Hash of the order so make sure nobody manipulated the data afterwards. Make sure the hash can only be set once (Access Modifiers))

4. Function to change Product amount (if order happens). Automatically set the correct state (enum) if the amount was changed. (Hint: Access Modifiers could be helpful here). Make sure only as much can be ordered as you have in stock.

5. If the product has less than 10 pieces left, set the status to "RefillNeeded"

5. When Product out of stock, a function that fills it up (set status to AwaitingShippment)

6. Menu Option: Show all products and amounts


Good luck!

Feel free to contact me, if you have questions.
